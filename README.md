Project by Nicholas Giampetro, Jayden Slotnick, Craig Stenstrom, Jordan Sprague, Payton Glynn

Originally completed for AERSP 313 on 12/11/2022, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

Numeric analysis in MATLAB of heat transfer utilizing Crank-Nicolson method to solve a PDE. Some code was provided by out class instructors, Dr. Huang and his TAs, which we filled in for this project.
